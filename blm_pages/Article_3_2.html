	<h3>How Black Lives Matter went from a hashtag to a global rallying cry - CNN (Excerpt)</h3>
	<p>(CNN)It began as a love letter to Black people in the wake of an unexpected verdict.</p>
	<p>It was July 2013 and George Zimmerman was on trial for murder in the killing of Trayvon Martin, a 17-year-old Black boy who had been walking in his father's Florida neighborhood. The night the verdict was set to be announced, Alicia Garza and some friends gathered for drinks.
None of them thought Zimmerman would be acquitted on all charges. But that's what happened. And Garza felt like she'd been punched in the gut, she told MSNBC.</p>

<p>That night Garza woke up in the middle of the night crying. So she began writing out how she felt, in an emotional Facebook post. She wrote that she continued to be surprised "at how little Black lives matter."
"That's really what Black Lives Matter was for me," Garza told MSNBC. "And that's why I said Black people, I love you. I love us. And that our lives matter. And that we matter. And that Black lives matter."
The phrase "Black lives matter" inspired Garza's friend, Patrisse Cullors, to create a hashtag. Almost instantly, it went viral.
"I wanted it to go viral," Cullors, who co-founded Black Lives Matter with Garza and Opal Tometi, told CNN.
"On July 15th, 2013 I said that Alicia and I had created a thing called #BlackLivesMatter and we hope that it will be bigger than we can ever imagine," Cullors said. "Over the last seven years we've developed more infrastructure and we've become more organized."
Momentum around the movement has grown amid calls for justice following the deaths of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor and George Floyd.
The phrase "Black Lives Matter" is being used now as more than just a hashtag -- it's a rallying cry. At protests, it's what many demonstrators write on their signs or chant as they march. Online, it's what many have used to spread the message against police brutality. And globally, it's being used by many to show solidarity with Black people.
While many believe the movement is more accepted than it once was, others remain skeptical of what it accomplishes and question its impact.
Here's what you need to know about the evolution of the movement, and why it matters.</p>

<p>Growth of a movement: 
Black Lives Matter is one of the most well-known organizations fighting for the well-being of Black people.
Studies show that segregation persists in many American cities, leaving majority Black communities behind. BLM's goal, according to its website, is to eradicate anti-Blackness and create a society where Black people are able to thrive in the US.
"We live in a country built to keep us away from these resources that we need," said Kailee Scales, managing director of the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation.
Scales referenced the data. Police officers are almost four times as likely to use force on Black people than White people. Black people are also jailed at a disproportionate rate. Black Americans have lower access to health care and lack the same access to quality education.
"Folks in the movement have been consistently fighting to reverse that trend, to raise awareness that this is not the way we're supposed to live," Scales told CNN.
Since the hashtag launched, the organization has become more formalized, taken on specific branding and branched out into nationwide chapters -- all in an attempt to solidify the group and allow them to create national campaigns while engaging the broader community.
Organizers put together a website, which led to the development of local chapters of BLM, first in Los Angeles in 2013 and then throughout the country, according to Scales.

<p>Why people are rallying behind BLM: 
It's been said that this moment feels different. It's bigger, more mainstream. White people are protesting just as much as people of color.
Even large corporations and brands, which may have been silent in the past, are getting involved.
Last month NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said "Black Lives Matter" in an apology video, a far cry from the league's stance during the 2016-17 season, when Colin Kaepernick became increasingly vocal about police brutality to the chagrin of the league. Kaepernick has not been with a team since.
Companies like Peloton, Disney, Facebook and others have spoken up against racial injustice, while the CEO of Netflix donated $120 million to historically Black colleges and universities.
Taylor Swift, who previously stayed away from anything remotely controversial, has voiced her support for the BLM movement, and even called for the removal of Confederate monuments in Tennessee. Meanwhile, Seth Rogen, Steve Carrell and others have donated to bail funds for protesters.

With the rise of social media in the 2010s, images showing police brutality against Black people have reached a much wider audience. Now a whole generation has grown up exposed to the issue of systemic racism.
Or, as Minneapolis community organizer Shanene Herbert put it, the trauma.
"They (young people) have experienced trauma," she told CNN. "Seeing your friends, your families and even yourself harassed by the police and killed by the police, it's traumatic. And they don't know what to do with that."
More people are demanding change. And BLM has been a big motivator in that shift. (...)</p>

<p>What the future holds: 
When asked what she hopes for BLM's future, co-founder Cullors said she knows the movement will win.

"I know this because our work is full of love, healing and dignity," she said. "And we center Black people's humanity and life over our death and decimation."
The task isn't an easy one. Kazin, the Georgetown professor, pointed out that the BLM movement is about power -- having power to decide how policing will look, or having power to access quality education.
BLM signs in windows, anti-racist reading lists -- all these things are good, Kazin said. But unless they are coupled with a true shift in power and larger political solidarity efforts, little will change.
Still, people are listening now. And Scales, like Cullors, is optimistic.
"At this point, we don't stop," she said. "We're not able to relax. It's now the opportunity to push for the true transformation that we've been working for."
