	<h3>Activists Painted 'Defund The Police' Next To The New Black Lives Matter Mural - NPR (Excerpt)</h3>
	<p>When Mayor Muriel Bowser unveiled a massive mural of the words Black Lives Matter, composed in bright yellow block letters that span a two-block stretch of road leading to the White House on Friday, she wanted to send a message to the world, and to the president.

On Saturday, in the center of D.C.'s largest day of protests in the wake of George Floyd's killing, local activists pulled out buckets and paint poles, and they used the exact same forum to paint their own statement: "Defund the police." They also covered over the stars in the D.C. flag, and used the same kind of typography as the original lettering, so the full message seamlessly read "Black Lives Matter = Defund the Police."

On Sunday morning, workers with the city's Department of Public Works, which helped arrange the original work, were spotted refreshing the paint—and restoring the stars. But they left the words.

Bowser did not respond to a request for comment about the decision, or how she planned to proceed with the unsanctioned addition.

	<p>"I think the fact that it's there really sends the message that black lives really do matter, and then seeing the diversity that's been out here for 12 days, and everybody supporting that," Williamson said, adding that it has been particularly heartening as he nears 50. "I've been dealing with this all my life. My three kids, who I thought would never have to deal with racism, have all gone through it. So, for me to see this mass amount of people out here and that message, I think it really puts a statement on that it really does matter."

The friends generally disagreed with the sentiment of defunding the police, saying that it should instead go to better training.

"We don't speak for everybody. You know, everybody's got their own opinion. But I agree with my boy, you know, I wouldn't necessarily necessarily say defund," Camp said. "I would just say move the funding in the right direction—eliminate that chokehold, teach him how to interact better with everyone."

But since Friday, other demonstrators have also scrawled messages on the massive yellow letters of the Black Lives Matter mural, with messages like "not good enough" and "f**k the 'mural,' change the system."</p>
<p>While the additions to the mural on 16th Street received the most attention, they weren't the only messages that activists left for D.C.'s politicians on the city's streets. Protesters painted a second "Defund the Police" mural outside the Wilson Building, where the D.C. Council meets. At one point, protesters laid around the words.

The legislative body is set to take up a bill this week that would ban the use of chokeholds, speed up the public release of footage from body-cameras, require that police officers involved in shooting deaths or other serious uses of force be named, and other steps.
