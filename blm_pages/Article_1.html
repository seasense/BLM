	<h3>Tucker Carlson: Black Lives Matter is now a powerful political party and has nothing to do with black lives. Fox News (excerpt)</h3>
	<p>America went insane over the weekend. That's barely an overstatement. People in their 80s who have lived in the U.S. all their lives said they've never seen anything like it. Ask an 80-year-old. This was without precedent in the modern era. A small group of highly aggressive emotionally charged activists took over our culture. They forced the entire country to obey their will. It all happened so fast and with such ferocity that virtually no one resisted it.</p>
	<p>People seem bewildered, even stunned by what was happening. Statements of fact and opinion that were entirely within the bounds of reasonable conversation just last Sunday, suddenly, a week later, were enough to get you fired from your job. And a number of people were fired. An awful lot happened this weekend. We want to assess the aftermath of it all, suggest what it may mean, and where this country is likely to go from here. But first, we want to give you a sense of what happened. We're going to begin in Minneapolis, where the Black Lives Matter riots first began almost two weeks ago. As the violence there raged, some Democratic leaders in Minneapolis came to a conclusion that didn't, on the surface anyway, make intuitive sense. What their city really needs, they decided, is less law enforcement -- in fact, no law enforcement. So, they began to demand that Minneapolis "defund the police." Now, the first thing you notice about this idea is how unpopular with the public it is. Almost nobody in the country supports it. But the activists, undeterred, kept pushing the idea, and within days, pressure mounted on the mayor of Minneapolis, Jacob Frey, to get rid of his city's police department.

		This was a problem for Frey. Frey has greater political aspirations. And this was the last conversation he wanted to have. So, Frey did his best to change the subject with a mix of manic enthusiasm, and feigned empathy.

		The most telling moment, though, came just before that, when the woman in sunglasses threatened to defeat the mayor in the next election. What does that tell you? It tells you that Black Lives Matter is in fact a political party, maybe the strongest political party in the United States. Its members believe they can reshape this country and so far, they're proving to be right.

You can always tell which political movements are ascendant, which are headed up, by how straightforward their members and sympathizers are about what they believe. Strong people say what they think out loud. They have no reason not to. They're not embarrassed about their beliefs. They think they're winning.
In the future, the left envisions, the only people who will have guns are people on their team, and that's exactly what defund the police really means. It means a woke militia policing our cities, enforcing Democratic Party orthodoxy.
With that in mind, watch this clip from CNN Monday morning. This is the president of the Minneapolis City Council, Lisa Bender. Bender explains that the desire for safety, the desire not to, for example, have your home invaded by violent criminals, is in fact a sign of racism.
Alisyn Camerota, CNN anchor: Do you understand that the word "dismantle" or "police-free" also makes some people nervous. For instance, what if in the middle of the night, my home is broken into. Who do I call?

<p>Lisa Bender, president of the Minneapolis City Council: Yes. I mean, I hear that loud and clear from a lot of my neighbors. And I know and myself, too, and I know that that comes from a place of privilege because for those of us for whom the system is working, I think we need to step back and imagine what it would feel like to already live in that reality, where calling the police may mean more harm is done.
"Hello, police? Armed men are breaking into my home. Help!" "Shut up, racist. Click." That's the world Lisa Bender is calling for.
How many people watching CNN this morning as they got dressed agreed with Lisa Bender? Sure, that sounds reasonable. Calling the police during a break-in definitely qualifies as racism. It's hard to believe even among CNN's audience that very many people thought that --  it's so obviously nuts.
On the other hand, it doesn't really matter at this point what the public thinks about anything. In the case of this idea, many Democratic leaders are already sold on it.
Here's former congressman Keith Ellison on MSNBC over the weekend. Keep in mind as you watch him speak that Ellison is now the chief law enforcement officer in Minnesota. He is the attorney general. Ellison argues that it's wrong for police to bring guns to domestic violence calls. Seriously.
Keith Ellison, attorney general of Minnesota: We send out people with guns, and they are there to use deadly force no matter what the problem may be.
If the problem is sexual assault, we send somebody with a gun. If the problem is domestic violence, we send somebody with a gun. If the problem is somebody with a mental health crisis, we send somebody with a gun.</p>

<p>Okay, we know what you're thinking. That's Keith Ellison, kind of an unfair example. Ellison has long been a crazy person who was once attached to the Nation of Islam. Back then, he called himself Keith Hakeem. More recently, Ellison endorsed Antifa. Yes, that's all true.

Democrats have no intention of abolishing the police. Listen carefully and you will hear them admit that. Instead, they want to replace the police -- take the people who currently have badges, many of whom, by the way, voted for Donald Trump and swap them out for new people, people who hate Donald Trump and hate the people who voted for Donald Trump.
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who is a skilled trend spotter if there ever was one, is already acting as if defund the police -- again, a proposal that no sane person even mentioned in public just last month -- is now the defining civil rights issue of our time. You'd have to be a bigoted dinosaur, a bad person, to oppose it.

Defund the police is a move toward authoritarian social control, cloaked in the language of identity politics. Already, in the middle of a total breakdown of law and order as we watch our cities burn, you are seeing new moves to prevent you from defending yourself and your family in the middle of it.</p>
